# Kawai K1 Panel for Ctrlr

This is a basic panel to control Kawai K1 series synthesizers from [Ctrlr](http://ctrlr.org/).
It's based on a panel [originally created by Stephen Hookings](https://sourceforge.net/projects/miniaktools/files/beta1/).

Currently, this panel has two main advantages over the original:
1. Automation parameters are cleaned up (unused params removed, and params renamed for clarity)
2. The look is simpler, with the virtual keyboard removed and parameters aligned for ease of use

I have vague plans to make it a lot richer, with patch saving and loading and maybe a patch randomizer, but no promises.
